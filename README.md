Problem Statement and Solution Approach
1. Appointment Management for Patients
Problem:
When visiting a doctor for a checkup, patients often have to wait in long queues just to get an appointment number, leading to unnecessary time wastage.

Solution:
A system that allows patients to book their appointment slots in advance, reducing waiting time and improving efficiency.

2. Centralized PathLab Report System
Problem:
Patients often misplace or forget their medical reports. Additionally, tracking past health records becomes difficult when reports are scattered across different labs.

Solution:
A centralized platform where both doctors and patients can access medical reports digitally. This system will:

Provide easy access to reports if a patient forgets to carry them.
Allow patients to view old reports to track their health progress over time.
3. PathLab Agent Comparison System
Problem:
Different pathology labs charge different prices for the same medical tests, and patients often struggle to find the best or most affordable option.

Solution:
A system that aggregates multiple pathology labs, allowing users to compare prices, services, and reviews before booking tests.
